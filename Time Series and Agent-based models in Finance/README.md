## Times Series and Agent-based models in Finance 

### Course Description : 

This course studies the pricing of financial assets using two approaches: financial time series econometrics and agent-based modeling. The course will be taught entirely in English (lectures, tutorials, labs, and exams).

The econometrics module emphasizes application over mathematical complexity. Its main objective is to equip students with the skills needed to independently perform time series analysis using numerical methods. Students will learn to analyze real-world data and effectively characterize key features of financial markets.

The agent-based modeling module demonstrates how investment strategies and learning shape price dynamics. While simple econometric strategies are used, the incorporation of learning introduces non-linearities that result in realistic price behavior.
